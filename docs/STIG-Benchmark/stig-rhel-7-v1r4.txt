Rule Title: The operating system must uniquely identify and must authenticate organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of organizational users) using multifactor authentication.
Description: To assure accountability and prevent unauthenticated access, organizational users must be identified and authenticated to prevent potential misuse and compromise of the system.\n\nOrganizational users include organizational employees or individuals the organization deems to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors). Organizational users (and processes acting on behalf of users) must be uniquely identified and authenticated to all accesses, except for the following:\n\n1) Accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization. Organizations document specific user actions that can be performed on the information system without identification or authentication; \n\nand\n\n2) Accesses that occur through authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for detailed accountability of individual activity.\n\n
Check_content: Verify the operating system requires multifactor authentication to uniquely identify organizational users using multifactor authentication.\n\nCheck to see if smartcard authentication is enforced on the system:\n\n# authconfig --test | grep -i smartcard\n\nThe entry for use only smartcard for logon may be enabled, and the smartcard module and smartcard removal actions must not be blank.\n\nIf smartcard authentication is disabled or the smartcard and smartcard removal actions are blank, this is a finding.

Rule Title: The operating system must prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures.
Description: Preventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions mitigates the risk that unauthorized individuals or processes may gain unnecessary access to information or privileges.\n\nPrivileged functions include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals who do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.
Check_content: Verify the operating system prevents non-privileged users from executing privileged functions to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures.\n\nGet a list of authorized users (other than System Administrator and guest accounts) for the system.\n\nCheck the list against the system by using the following command:\n\n# semanage login -l | more\nLogin Name  SELinux User   MLS/MCS Range  Service\n__default__  user_u    s0-s0:c0.c1023   *\nroot   unconfined_u   s0-s0:c0.c1023   *\nsystem_u  system_u   s0-s0:c0.c1023   *\njoe  staff_u   s0-s0:c0.c1023   *\n\nAll administrators must be mapped to the "sysadm_u" or "staff_u" users with the appropriate domains (sysadm_t and staff_t).\n\nAll authorized non-administrative users must be mapped to the "user_u" role or the appropriate domain (user_t).\n\nIf they are not mapped in this way, this is a finding.

Rule Title: A file integrity tool must verify the baseline operating system configuration at least weekly.
Description: Unauthorized changes to the baseline configuration could make the system vulnerable to various attacks or allow unauthorized access to the operating system. Changes to operating system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may be relevant to security.\n\nDetecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of the operating system. The operating system's Information Management Officer (IMO)/Information System Security Officer (ISSO) and System Administrators (SAs) must be notified via email and/or monitoring system trap when there is an unauthorized modification of a configuration item.
Check_content: Verify the operating system routinely checks the baseline configuration for unauthorized changes.\n\nNote: A file integrity tool other than Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) may be used, but the tool must be executed at least once per week.\n\nCheck to see if AIDE is installed on the system with the following command:\n\n# yum list installed aide\n\nIf AIDE is not installed, ask the SA how file integrity checks are performed on the system.\n\nCheck for the presence of a cron job running daily or weekly on the system that executes AIDE daily to scan for changes to the system baseline. The command used in the example will use a daily occurrence.\n\nCheck the "/etc/cron.daily" subdirectory for a "crontab" file controlling the execution of the file integrity application. For example, if AIDE is installed on the system, use the following command:\n\n# ls -al /etc/cron.* | grep aide\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root        29 Nov  22  2015 aide\n\nIf the file integrity application does not exist, or a "crontab" file does not exist in the "/etc/cron.daily" or "/etc/cron.weekly" subdirectories, this is a finding.

Rule Title: All local interactive user home directories defined in the /etc/passwd file must exist.
Description: If a local interactive user has a home directory defined that does not exist, the user may be given access to the / directory as the current working directory upon logon. This could create a Denial of Service because the user would not be able to access their logon configuration files, and it may give them visibility to system files they normally would not be able to access.

Without this notification, the security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability, and system operation may be adversely affected.\n\nAudit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.\n\nThis requirement applies to each audit data storage repository (i.e., distinct information system component where audit records are stored), the centralized audit storage capacity of organizations (i.e., all audit data storage repositories combined), or both.\n\n
Check_content: Confirm the audit configuration regarding how auditing processing failures are handled.\n\nCheck to see what level "auditctl" is set to with following command: \n\n# auditctl -s | grep -i "fail"\n\nfailure 2\n\nIf the value of "failure" is set to "2", the system is configured to panic (shut down) in the event of an auditing failure.\n\nIf the value of "failure" is set to "1", the system is configured to only send information to the kernel log regarding the failure.\n\nIf the "failure" setting is not set, this is a CAT I finding.\n\nIf the "failure" setting is set to any value other than "1" or "2", this is a CAT II finding.\n\nIf the "failure" setting is set to "1" but the availability concern is not documented or there is no monitoring of the kernel log, this is a CAT III finding.\n
Fixtext: Configure the operating system to shut down in the event of an audit processing failure.\n\nAdd or correct the option to shut down the operating system with the following command:\n\n# auditctl -f 2\n\nEdit the "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules" file and add the following line:\n\n-f 2\n\nIf availability has been determined to be more important, and this decision is documented with the ISSO, configure the operating system to notify system administration staff and ISSO staff in the event of an audit processing failure with the following command:\n\n# auditctl -f 1\n\nEdit the "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules" file and add the following line:\n\n-f 1\n\nKernel log monitoring must also be configured to properly alert designated staff.\n\nThe audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

Rule Title: The operating system must off-load audit records onto a different system or media from the system being audited.
Description: Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration.\n\nOff-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity.\n\n
Check_content: Verify the operating system off-loads audit records onto a different system or media from the system being audited.\n\nTo determine the remote server that the records are being sent to, use the following command:\n\n# grep -i remote_server /etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf\nremote_server = 10.0.21.1\n\nIf a remote server is not configured, or the line is commented out, ask the System Administrator to indicate how the audit logs are off-loaded to a different system or media. \n\nIf there is no evidence that the audit logs are being off-loaded to another system or media, this is a finding.
Fixtext: Configure the operating system to off-load audit records onto a different system or media from the system being audited.\n\nSet the remote server option in "/etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf" with the IP address of the log aggregation server.

Rule Title: The operating system must limit the number of concurrent sessions to 10 for all accounts and/or account types.
Description: Operating system management includes the ability to control the number of users and user sessions that utilize an operating system. Limiting the number of allowed users and sessions per user is helpful in reducing the risks related to DoS attacks.\n\nThis requirement addresses concurrent sessions for information system accounts and does not address concurrent sessions by single users via multiple system accounts. The maximum number of concurrent sessions should be defined based on mission needs and the operational environment for each system.
Check_content: Verify the operating system limits the number of concurrent sessions to "10" for all accounts and/or account types by issuing the following command:\n\n# grep "maxlogins" /etc/security/limits.conf\n* hard maxlogins 10\n\nThis can be set as a global domain (with the * wildcard) but may be set differently for multiple domains.\n\nIf the "maxlogins" item is missing or the value is not set to "10" or less for all domains that have the "maxlogins" item assigned, this is a finding.

Rule Title: The host must be configured to prohibit or restrict the use of functions, ports, protocols, and/or services, as defined in the Ports, Protocols, and Services Management Component Local Service Assessment (PPSM CLSA) and vulnerability assessments.
Description: In order to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types within data types), organizations must disable or restrict unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols on information systems.\n\nOperating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component (e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component.\n\nTo support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the operating system must support the organizational requirements, providing only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols, and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to conduct official business or to address authorized quality of life issues.\n\n
Check_content: Inspect the firewall configuration and running services to verify that it is configured to prohibit or restrict the use of functions, ports, protocols, and/or services that are unnecessary or prohibited.\n\nCheck which services are currently active with the following command:\n\n# firewall-cmd --list-all\npublic (default, active)\n  interfaces: enp0s3\n  sources: \n  services: dhcpv6-client dns http https ldaps rpc-bind ssh\n  ports: \n  masquerade: no\n  forward-ports: \n  icmp-blocks: \n  rich rules: \n\nAsk the System Administrator for the site or program PPSM CLSA.

Rule Title: A FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic algorithm must be used for SSH communications.
Description: Unapproved mechanisms that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module are not verified and therefore cannot be relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and DoD data may be compromised.\n\nOperating systems utilizing encryption are required to use FIPS-compliant mechanisms for authenticating to cryptographic modules.\n\nFIPS 140-2 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to access cryptographic modules utilize authentication that meets DoD requirements. This allows for Security Levels 1, 2, 3, or 4 for use on a general purpose computing system.\n\n
Check_content: Verify the operating system uses mechanisms meeting the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance for authentication to a cryptographic module.\n\nNote: If RHEL-07-021350 is a finding, this is automatically a finding as the system cannot implement FIPS 140-2-approved cryptographic algorithms and hashes.\n\nThe location of the "sshd_config" file may vary if a different daemon is in use.\n\nInspect the "Ciphers" configuration with the following command:\n\n# grep -i ciphers /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nCiphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr\n\nIf any ciphers other than "aes128-ctr", "aes192-ctr", or "aes256-ctr" are listed, the "Ciphers" keyword is missing, or the retuned line is commented out, this is a finding.

Rule Title: All network connections associated with a communication session must be terminated at the end of the session or after 10 minutes of inactivity from the user at a command prompt, except to fulfill documented and validated mission requirements.
Description: Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element. \n\nTerminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean that the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session and releases the resources associated with that session.
Check_content: Verify the operating system terminates all network connections associated with a communications session at the end of the session or based on inactivity.\n\nCheck the value of the system inactivity timeout with the following command:\n\n# grep -i tmout /etc/bashrc /etc/profile.d/*\n\nTMOUT=600\n\nIf "TMOUT" is not set to "600" or less in "/etc/bashrc" or in a script created to enforce session termination after inactivity, this is a finding.

Rule Title: The operating system must protect against or limit the effects of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by validating the operating system is implementing rate-limiting measures on impacted network interfaces.
Description: DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate users. When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must operate at degraded capacity.\n\nThis requirement addresses the configuration of the operating system to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or are ongoing on system availability. For each system, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or establishing memory partitions). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.
Check_content: Verify the operating system protects against or limits the effects of DoS attacks by ensuring the operating system is implementing rate-limiting measures on impacted network interfaces.\n\nCheck the firewall configuration with the following command:\n\nNote: The command is to query rules for the public zone.\n\n# firewall-cmd --direct --get-rule ipv4 filter IN_public_allow\nrule ipv4 filter IN_public_allow 0 -p tcp -m limit --limit 25/minute --limit-burst 100  -j ACCEPT\n\nIf a rule with both the limit and limit-burst arguments parameters does not exist, this is a finding.

Rule Title: Wireless network adapters must be disabled.
Description: The use of wireless networking can introduce many different attack vectors into the organization's network. Common attack vectors such as malicious association and ad hoc networks will allow an attacker to spoof a wireless access point (AP), allowing validated systems to connect to the malicious AP and enabling the attacker to monitor and record network traffic. These malicious APs can also serve to create a man-in-the-middle attack or be used to create a denial of service to valid network resources.
Check_content: Verify that there are no wireless interfaces configured on the system.\n\nThis is N/A for systems that do not have wireless network adapters.\n\nCheck for the presence of active wireless interfaces with the following command:\n\n# nmcli device\nDEVICE TYPE STATE\neth0 ethernet connected\nwlp3s0 wifi disconnected\nlo loopback unmanaged\n\nIf a wireless interface is configured and its use on the system is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO), this is a finding.
Fixtext: Configure the system to disable all wireless network interfaces with the following command:\n\n#nmcli radio wifi off

Rule Title: The operating system must implement virtual address space randomization.
Description: Address space layout randomization (ASLR) makes it more difficult for an attacker to predict the location of attack code he or she has introduced into a process's address space during an attempt at exploitation. Additionally, ASLR also makes it more difficult for an attacker to know the location of existing code in order to repurpose it using return-oriented programming (ROP) techniques.
Check_content: Verify the operating system implements virtual address space randomization.\n\nCheck that the operating system implements virtual address space randomization with the following command:\n\n# grep kernel.randomize_va_space /etc/sysctl.conf \n\nkernel.randomize_va_space=2\n\nIf "kernel.randomize_va_space" does not have a value of "2", this is a finding.
